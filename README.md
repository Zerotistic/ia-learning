# ia-learning
i wrote some helpful comments inside of [this file](https://github.com/Zerotistic/ia-learning/blob/main/ia-test-and-notes.ipynb) about a lot (probably not everything) to know on machine learning, with example.<br>
this is meant as personal notes first, however you're free to create and issue and exchange with me on how i could make something better, or add something.<br>
i'll update it when i feel like it needs to be, however as i currently am learning a lot, it should receives a decent amount of updates
